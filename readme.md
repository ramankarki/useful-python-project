- if your important files are deep nested in directories, than you can use this script to find your files by giving file-extension as an argument and using cp [optiona] argument to copy all files of that file-extension and pasting into new directory.
- you can use rm argument to remove all the unnecessary files in same way.

# Usage: python files_finder.py file-extension filepath/directory [rm] [cp]
file-extension eg: .docx
filepath/directory eg: /document/files
